    "ZS Associates hosted a data science competition on HackerRank last weekend. This was my final code submission for the competition. The data set was very tricky this time. Most of my time was spent trying to create a suitable dataset on which I could train my model and predict the solution. The evaluation metric they used for classification was F1 score and for regression they had their own metric. The maximum classification accuracy I was able to achieve was 30.12% giving me a 0.15 score on the leaderboard. For regression they had a very tricky metric and to get a positive score on that metric was nearly impossible without a good classification accuracy as we were supposed to predict revenue in our regression part and without correctly identifying the lease instrument there was no point in predicting the revenue.

    "Using random forest feature importance, I checked the most important features of the dataset and saw that the ratio and rating features were the most helpful ones. I tried a few more features but still was not able to improve my lb score. The solution dataset was heavily imbalanced as it contained very few positive results as compared to negative ones. I was gettting around 23K 1's and 1.7 lakhs 0's and my lb score was 0.15 and one of my friends who was getting around 10K 1's was getting the almost same lb score. F1 score is a tricky metric; if either of the precision or recall gets screwed up, it scews your entire result."

Another one of the features which I never used was hospital employees. Hospital employees was not helping me with the prediction and as I already stated that the H-D combination present in the profiling dataframe was very different from the one present in revenue and solution dataframe so on merging these dataframe I was getting lots of missing value in hospital employee columns, so a after few tries I decided to skip this feature."
